# What is superQuery?

superQuery is a web-based IDE that helps data analysts & scientists work more productively when querying data stored in Google BigQuery, AWS Athena (S3), and AWS DynamoDB.

### What can I do with superQuery?

You can use superQuery to:

* **Leverage best-in-class query management**
  * Use [Query Tabs](superquery-editor/query-tabs.md) to work across many queries and easily switch between different results
  * Organize queries into folder-like [Boards](superquery-editor/organizing-queries.md)\

* **Shorten pre-existing workflows**
  * Never worry about forgetting to save queries with Google Docs-like query auto-save.
  * Use variables to [make your queries dynamic](superquery-editor/variables.md) and save time when modifying them
  * Avoid having to save large results as a table with a much-larger 6,000,000 row export limit.
  * Looking for a particular query but forgot the name? Use [SQL Search](superquery-editor/sql-search.md) to quickly find it.
  * Immediately know how much your query is going to cost without doing the math yourself.\

* **Generate one-click Charts and Dashboards**
  * Transform your query results into [Charts](superquery-editor/charts.md) that tell a story that tables can't.
  * Combine multiple query results into a [Dashboard](dashboards/create-dashboards.md) without having to export to a BI tool or Sheets.\

* **Version-control your work**
  * Commit your queries to [GitHub](https://help.superquery.io/git-integrations/connect-github) and [GitLab](https://help.superquery.io/git-integrations/connect-gitlab)
  * View an unlimited version history for every query tab and BigQuery views\

* **Collaborate on work with your team**
  * Share [individual queries](superquery-editor/query-tabs.md#share-tab) or [entire Boards](superquery-editor/organizing-queries.md#share-a-board) containing groups of queries and visualizations
